## Introduction
The **Network File System (NFS)** protocol allows files stored on a server to be accessed and manipulated as if they were stored locally on any computer connected to the network. This reduces storage costs and enhances collaboration while addressing security concerns. NFS is widely used to manage and share files across multiple systems effectively.

## Protocol Operation
NFS enables remote systems to mount file systems over a network. Key functionalities include:
1. Using the `mount` command for client-server connections.
2. Allowing access to server files via various platforms.
3. Supporting file locking for secure simultaneous access by multiple clients.
